# Tailwind CSS Project

This is a simple project built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for creating modern and responsive designs quickly.

## Features

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Customizable and extendable theme.
- Fast development with minimal custom CSS.
- Compatible with popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the following:

- Node.js (>= 12.x)
- npm or yarn (for package management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tailwindcss-project.git
   cd tailwindcss-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Install Tailwind CSS via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn add -D tailwindcss
   ```

4. Initialize Tailwind:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

   This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project.

## Usage

1. In your CSS file (e.g., `src/styles.css`), include the following lines to use Tailwind's base, components, and utilities:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

2. Update your `tailwind.config.js` if needed to customize the design, theme, or extend Tailwind's functionality.

3. Build your CSS using the Tailwind CLI or any build tool like PostCSS:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o dist/styles.css
   ```

4. Now, you can include the generated `dist/styles.css` file in your HTML or framework-based app.

### Development Server

If you're using a development framework (like React, Vue, etc.), you can start your development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, make sure to purge unused styles by enabling the purge option in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./src/**/*.html', './src/**/*.js'],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Then, run the build process:

```bash
npm run build
```
