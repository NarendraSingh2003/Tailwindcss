# Tailwind CSS Project

This project is a simple implementation of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Introduction

Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without leaving your HTML. This project aims to demonstrate how to integrate and use Tailwind CSS in a web development environment.


## Usage

- Build your HTML structure using utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS. Each class corresponds to a specific style, making it easy to design without writing custom CSS.
- For production, ensure youâ€™re purging unused styles to keep your CSS file size small.
- Tailwind CSS provides responsive utility classes to adjust styles at different breakpoints.
